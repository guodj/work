  Abstract                 = {{An established high-resolution dynamical model is employed to understand
 the behavior of the thermosphere beneath the Earth's magnetic cusps,
 with emphasis on the factors contributing to the density structures
 observed by the CHAMP and Streak satellite missions. In contrast to
 previous modeling efforts, this approach combines first principles
 dynamical modeling with the high spatial resolution needed to describe
 accurately mesoscale features such as the cusp. The resulting density
 structure is shown to be consistent with observations, including regions
 of both enhanced and diminished neutral density along the satellite
 track. This agreement is shown to be the result of a straightforward
 application of input conditions commonly found in the cusp rather than
 exaggerated or extreme conditions. It is found that the magnitude of the
 density change is sensitive to the width of the cusp region and that
 models that can resolve widths on the order of 2 degrees of latitude are
 required to predict density variations that are consistent with the
 observations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Observations have revealed large Poynting flux and soft electron
 precipitation around the cusp region, which have strong impacts on the
 polar ionosphere/thermosphere. Simulations also confirmed that Poynting
 flux and soft electron precipitation significantly change the neutral
 density and dynamics around the dayside polar cap boundary regions.
 However, no detailed study has been conducted to show if they should
 coincide with each other or not. Our analysis of Defense Meteorological
 Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite data reveals a complex correlation
 between them. Poynting flux and soft particle precipitation are
 coincident in some cases (match cases), but a clear displacement between
 them can also be identified in others (nonmatch cases). In the 29 cusp
 crossings from F13 we investigated, the ratio between nonmatch and match
 cases is close to 1:4. In nonmatch cases, the displacement between the
 Poynting flux enhancement and soft particle precipitation enhancement
 can be as large as 1 degrees in geomagnetic latitude.}},

  Abstract                 = {Thermospheric densities near 200 km from the Satellite Electrostatic Triaxial Accelerometer (SETA) experiment during July and December 1983 are analyzed to reveal two types of longitude structures: (1) the so-called “longitude/UT” variation which has been noted in higher-altitude satellite data and incorporated into the mass spectrometer incoherent scatter extension-90 (MSISE-90) empirical model [Hedin, 1991] and (2) “higher-order structures” in the form of longitudinal wave patterns which have not previously been mentioned in the thermosphere-ionosphere literature. The longitude/UT variation in the SETA densities shares many similarities with that embodied in the MSISE-90 model, except for some differences in symmetry about the equator. Interpretation concerning the origin of the observed variation is handicapped by the Sun-synchronous limitations of the satellite orbit and by the convolution of high-latitude heating effects being mapped into the geographic frame while solar-driven latitudinal variations are mapped into the geomagnetic frame. An unambiguous separation of these effects is not possible with the present orbital constraints. The space-time Fourier analysis method of Salby [1982a, b] is applied in an attempt to quantitatively characterize the higher-order structure in the data. The nature of the satellite sampling introduces ambiguities into the determination of zonal wavenumbers and periodicities. There is evidence of s = 1 and s = 2 stationary features, eastward propagating Kelvin waves, and a number of westward propagating waves with zonal wavenumbers s = 0 to s = 6 and periods between 6 and 10 hours. Meyer and Forbes [1997] have recently shown the latter class of waves, referred to as Lamb waves in an isothermal nondissipative atmosphere, to represent the preferred response to broadband forcing of the thermosphere. The present observations may represent the existence of Lamb waves in the thermosphere.},

Tabulations from the Handbook for MAP 16 are the primary guide for the lower atmosphere and are supplemented by historical rocket and incoherent scatter data in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2%. Comparison with rocket and other data indicates that the model represents current knowledge of the climatological average reasonably well, although there is some conflict as to details near the mesopause.},

A universal time (UT) variation in average density levels is evident near both the geographic and magnetic poles. There are systematic morphology changes with UT and between summer and winter which are qualitatively consistent with the shifting and spreading of thermospheric heating effects by the global circulation systems driven by EUV and magnetospheric sources. The magnitude of the UT variations is larger in the southern hemisphere on average, and the UT variations are larger in local winter than summer.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of neutral N2, O, and He densities from Ogo 6 over the south polar region during magnetically quiet periods in late August and early September 1969 indicate that N2 densities, when they are extrapolated to a common altitude, maximize at about 0800 UT near 70° invariant latitude. The density of He has a minimum at this time, and the density of O has a slight maximum. It is proposed that these phenomena are the result of cyclic variations in soft electron precipitation, which heats the thermosphere either directly or through enhanced Joule heating. This heat energy would increase the gas temperature, the increase in the gas temperature leading to the N2 increase, and would vary the composition by generation of a wind system.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of N2, O, He, and Ar densities from neutral gas mass spectrometers on four satellites (Ogo 6, Aeros A, AE-C, and AE-D) and inferred O2 and H densities from an ion mass spectrometer on AE-C have been combined to produce a model of longitude/universal time (UT) variations in thermospheric neutral temperature and composition. The longitude/UT model is an extension of the mass spectrometer-incoherent scatter thermospheric model and uses spherical harmonic terms dependent on geographic latitude, longitude, and universal time. The terms which depend only on longitude indicate a temperature enhancement of about 30°K somewhat equatorward of the magnetic poles. The temperature varies also in universal time, the greatest enhancement being about 30°K near 2130 UT in the northern hemisphere and about 70°K near 0930 UT in the southern hemisphere. The extrapolated 120-km variations are generally in phase for Ar and O2 and out of phase for He, O, and H. Changes during magnetic storms are relatively small. The combined longitude and UT variations reflect the influence of the earth's magnetic field but indicate that the variations may not be simply represented in magnetic coordinates. The longitude/UT model helps reduce differences in the local time variation between the incoherent scatter stations.},

 provides the opportunity to investigate the thermospheric dynamics in
 great detail. In this study we concentrate on density structures in the
 cusp. During 25 Sep. 2000, the day we take as an example, air density
 enhancements of almost a factor of two are observed whenever the
 satellite passes the cusp region. For the interpretation of these events
 we consider also the concurrent ionospheric Hall and field-aligned
 currents (FACs). As expected, sizable currents are found in the regions
 of dense air. Small-scale FAC filaments (1-km size) seem to play an
 important role in the heating. Whenever these very intense FACs with
 amplitudes of several hundreds of muA/m(2) show up, density enhancements
 occur.}},

  Abstract                 = {The solar minimum of 2008 was exceptionally quiet, with sunspot numbers at their lowest in 75 years. During this unique solar-minimum epoch, however, solar-wind high-speed streams emanating from near-equatorial coronal holes occurred frequently and were the primary contributor to the recurrent geomagnetic activity at Earth. These conditions enabled the isolation of forcing by geomagnetic activity on the preconditioned solar minimum state of the upper atmosphere caused by Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs). Thermosphere density observations around 400 km from the CHAMP satellite are used to study the thermosphere density response to solar-wind high-speed streams/CIRs. Superposed epoch results show that the thermosphere density responds to high-speed streams globally, and the density at 400 km changes by 75\% on average. The relative changes of neutral density are comparable at different latitudes, although its variability is largest at high latitudes. In addition, the response of thermosphere density to high-speed streams is larger at night than in daytime, indicating the preconditioning effect of the thermosphere response to storms. Finally, the thermosphere density variations at the periods of 9 and 13.5 days associated with CIRs are linked to the spatial distribution of low\thinspace--\thinspacemiddle latitude coronal holes on the basis of the EUVI observations from STEREO.},

We summarize these signatures and their implications for understanding the nature of these structures and the physical properties of coronal mass ejections. We conclude that our understanding of ICMEs is far from complete and formulate several challenges that, if addressed, would substantially improve our knowledge of the relationship between CMEs at the Sun and in the heliosphere.},
