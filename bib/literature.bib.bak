  Abstract                 = {{An established high-resolution dynamical model is employed to understand
 the behavior of the thermosphere beneath the Earth's magnetic cusps,
 with emphasis on the factors contributing to the density structures
 observed by the CHAMP and Streak satellite missions. In contrast to
 previous modeling efforts, this approach combines first principles
 dynamical modeling with the high spatial resolution needed to describe
 accurately mesoscale features such as the cusp. The resulting density
 structure is shown to be consistent with observations, including regions
 of both enhanced and diminished neutral density along the satellite
 track. This agreement is shown to be the result of a straightforward
 application of input conditions commonly found in the cusp rather than
 exaggerated or extreme conditions. It is found that the magnitude of the
 density change is sensitive to the width of the cusp region and that
 models that can resolve widths on the order of 2 degrees of latitude are
 required to predict density variations that are consistent with the
 observations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Observations have revealed large Poynting flux and soft electron
 precipitation around the cusp region, which have strong impacts on the
 polar ionosphere/thermosphere. Simulations also confirmed that Poynting
 flux and soft electron precipitation significantly change the neutral
 density and dynamics around the dayside polar cap boundary regions.
 However, no detailed study has been conducted to show if they should
 coincide with each other or not. Our analysis of Defense Meteorological
 Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite data reveals a complex correlation
 between them. Poynting flux and soft particle precipitation are
 coincident in some cases (match cases), but a clear displacement between
 them can also be identified in others (nonmatch cases). In the 29 cusp
 crossings from F13 we investigated, the ratio between nonmatch and match
 cases is close to 1:4. In nonmatch cases, the displacement between the
 Poynting flux enhancement and soft particle precipitation enhancement
 can be as large as 1 degrees in geomagnetic latitude.}},

  Abstract                 = {Thermospheric densities near 200 km from the Satellite Electrostatic Triaxial Accelerometer (SETA) experiment during July and December 1983 are analyzed to reveal two types of longitude structures: (1) the so-called âlongitude/UTâ variation which has been noted in higher-altitude satellite data and incorporated into the mass spectrometer incoherent scatter extension-90 (MSISE-90) empirical model [Hedin, 1991] and (2) âhigher-order structuresâ in the form of longitudinal wave patterns which have not previously been mentioned in the thermosphere-ionosphere literature. The longitude/UT variation in the SETA densities shares many similarities with that embodied in the MSISE-90 model, except for some differences in symmetry about the equator. Interpretation concerning the origin of the observed variation is handicapped by the Sun-synchronous limitations of the satellite orbit and by the convolution of high-latitude heating effects being mapped into the geographic frame while solar-driven latitudinal variations are mapped into the geomagnetic frame. An unambiguous separation of these effects is not possible with the present orbital constraints. The space-time Fourier analysis method of Salby [1982a, b] is applied in an attempt to quantitatively characterize the higher-order structure in the data. The nature of the satellite sampling introduces ambiguities into the determination of zonal wavenumbers and periodicities. There is evidence of s = 1 and s = 2 stationary features, eastward propagating Kelvin waves, and a number of westward propagating waves with zonal wavenumbers s = 0 to s = 6 and periods between 6 and 10 hours. Meyer and Forbes [1997] have recently shown the latter class of waves, referred to as Lamb waves in an isothermal nondissipative atmosphere, to represent the preferred response to broadband forcing of the thermosphere. The present observations may represent the existence of Lamb waves in the thermosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {The MSIS-86 empirical model has been revised in the lower thermosphere and extended into the mesosphere and lower atmosphere to provide a single analytic model for calculating temperature and density profiles representative of the climatological average for various geophysical conditions. Tabulations from the Handbook for MAP 16 are the primary guide for the lower atmosphere and are supplemented by historical rocket and incoherent scatter data in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2%. Comparison with rocket and other data indicates that the model represents current knowledge of the climatological average reasonably well, although there is some conflict as to details near the mesopause.},

  Abstract                 = {Composition data obtained by the Neutral Atmosphere Composition Spectrometer carried aboard the Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite have been examined for variations in the polar regions during magnetically quiet conditions. A persistent enhancement of N2 density and a depletion of He density are present in the vicinity of the magnetic poles with maximum density response in the morning hours (magnetic) on average. A universal time (UT) variation in average density levels is evident near both the geographic and magnetic poles. There are systematic morphology changes with UT and between summer and winter which are qualitatively consistent with the shifting and spreading of thermospheric heating effects by the global circulation systems driven by EUV and magnetospheric sources. The magnitude of the UT variations is larger in the southern hemisphere on average, and the UT variations are larger in local winter than summer.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of neutral N2, O, and He densities from Ogo 6 over the south polar region during magnetically quiet periods in late August and early September 1969 indicate that N2 densities, when they are extrapolated to a common altitude, maximize at about 0800 UT near 70Â° invariant latitude. The density of He has a minimum at this time, and the density of O has a slight maximum. It is proposed that these phenomena are the result of cyclic variations in soft electron precipitation, which heats the thermosphere either directly or through enhanced Joule heating. This heat energy would increase the gas temperature, the increase in the gas temperature leading to the N2 increase, and would vary the composition by generation of a wind system.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of N2, O, He, and Ar densities from neutral gas mass spectrometers on four satellites (Ogo 6, Aeros A, AE-C, and AE-D) and inferred O2 and H densities from an ion mass spectrometer on AE-C have been combined to produce a model of longitude/universal time (UT) variations in thermospheric neutral temperature and composition. The longitude/UT model is an extension of the mass spectrometer-incoherent scatter thermospheric model and uses spherical harmonic terms dependent on geographic latitude, longitude, and universal time. The terms which depend only on longitude indicate a temperature enhancement of about 30Â°K somewhat equatorward of the magnetic poles. The temperature varies also in universal time, the greatest enhancement being about 30Â°K near 2130 UT in the northern hemisphere and about 70Â°K near 0930 UT in the southern hemisphere. The extrapolated 120-km variations are generally in phase for Ar and O2 and out of phase for He, O, and H. Changes during magnetic storms are relatively small. The combined longitude and UT variations reflect the influence of the earth's magnetic field but indicate that the variations may not be simply represented in magnetic coordinates. The longitude/UT model helps reduce differences in the local time variation between the incoherent scatter stations.},

  Abstract                 = {{{[}1] The satellite CHAMP with its sensitive accelerometer on board
 provides the opportunity to investigate the thermospheric dynamics in
 great detail. In this study we concentrate on density structures in the
 cusp. During 25 Sep. 2000, the day we take as an example, air density
 enhancements of almost a factor of two are observed whenever the
 satellite passes the cusp region. For the interpretation of these events
 we consider also the concurrent ionospheric Hall and field-aligned
 currents (FACs). As expected, sizable currents are found in the regions
 of dense air. Small-scale FAC filaments (1-km size) seem to play an
 important role in the heating. Whenever these very intense FACs with
 amplitudes of several hundreds of muA/m(2) show up, density enhancements
 occur.}},

  Abstract                 = {The solar minimum of 2008 was exceptionally quiet, with sunspot numbers at their lowest in 75 years. During this unique solar-minimum epoch, however, solar-wind high-speed streams emanating from near-equatorial coronal holes occurred frequently and were the primary contributor to the recurrent geomagnetic activity at Earth. These conditions enabled the isolation of forcing by geomagnetic activity on the preconditioned solar minimum state of the upper atmosphere caused by Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs). Thermosphere density observations around 400Â km from the CHAMP satellite are used to study the thermosphere density response to solar-wind high-speed streams/CIRs. Superposed epoch results show that the thermosphere density responds to high-speed streams globally, and the density at 400 km changes by 75\% on average. The relative changes of neutral density are comparable at different latitudes, although its variability is largest at high latitudes. In addition, the response of thermosphere density to high-speed streams is larger at night than in daytime, indicating the preconditioning effect of the thermosphere response to storms. Finally, the thermosphere density variations at the periods of 9 and 13.5Â days associated with CIRs are linked to the spatial distribution of low\thinspace--\thinspacemiddle latitude coronal holes on the basis of the EUVI observations from STEREO.},

Recently, new ground-based observations, combined with in situ satellite measurements, have led the way in reinterpreting cusp signatures. These observations, combined with theoretical advances, have stimulated new interest in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling chain. This coupling process is important because it causes both momentum and energy from the solar wind to enter into the near-Earth region. Here we describe the current ideas concerning the cusps and the supporting observational evidence which have evolved over the past 30 years. We include discussion on the plasma entry process, particle motion between the magnetopause and ionosphere, ground optical and radar measurements, and transient events. We also review the important questions that remain to be answered.},

  abstract  = {During the past six years, rapid advances in three observational techniques (ground-based radars, optical interferometers and satellite-borne instruments) have provided a means of observing a wide range of spectacular interactions between the coupled magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere system. Perhaps the most fundamental gain has come from the combined data-sets from the NASA Dynamics Explorer (DE) Satellites. These have unambiguously described the global nature of thermospheric flows, and their response to magnetospheric forcing. The DE spacecraft have also described, at the same time, the magnetospheric particle precipitation and convective electric fields which force the polar thermosphere and ionosphere. The response of the thermosphere to magnetospheric forcing is far more complex than merely the rare excitation of 1 km s$^{-1}$ wind speeds and strong heating; the heating causes large-scale convection and advection within the thermosphere. These large winds grossly change the compositional structure of the upper thermosphere at high and middle latitudes during major geomagnetic disturbances. Some of the major seasonal and geomagnetic storm-related anomalies of the ionosphere are directly attributable to the gross wind-induced changes of thermospheric composition; the mid-latitude ionospheric storm {\textquoteleft}negative phase{\textquoteright}, however, is yet to be fully understood. The combination of very strong polar wind velocities and rapid plasma convection forced by magnetospheric electric fields strongly and rapidly modify F-region plasma distributions generated by the combination of local solar and auroral ionization sources. Until recently, however, it has been difficult to interpret the observed complex spatial and time-dependent structures and motions of the thermosphere and ionosphere because of their strong and nonlinear coupling. It has recently been possible to complete a numerical and computational merging of the University College London (UCL) global thermospheric model and the Sheffield University ionospheric model. This has produced a self-consistent coupled thermospheric--ionospheric model, which has become a valuable diagnostic tool for examining thermospheric--ionospheric interactions in the polar regions. In particular, it is possible to examine the effects of induced winds, ion transport, and the seasonal and diurnal U.T. variations of solar heating and photoionization within the polar regions. Polar and high-latitude plasma density structure at F-region altitudes can be seen to be strongly controlled by U.T., and by season, even for constant solar and geomagnetic activity. In the winter, the F-region polar plasma density is generally dominated by the effects of transport of plasma from the dayside (sunlit cusp). In the summer polar region, however, an increase in the proportion of molecular to atomic species, created by the global seasonal circulation and augmented by the geomagnetic forcing, controls the plasma composition and generally depresses plasma densities at all U.Ts. A number of these complex effects can be seen in data obtained from ground-based radars, Fabry--Perot interferometers and in the combined DE data-sets. Several of these observations will be used, in combination with simulations using the UCL--Sheffield coupled model, to illustrate the major features of large-scale thermosphere--ionosphere interactions in response to geomagnetic forcing. The past decade has seen a major improvement in the quality and quantity of experimental data available to study the thermosphere and ionosphere and their response to magnetospheric forcing. Earlier, large measured changes of individual parameters were difficult to place in a global or large-scale perspective. However, a clear picture of the distinction between the solar and geomagnetic forcing processes has emerged from the combined data-sets available from spacecraft such as the Dynamics Explorers, and from ground-based radar and optical observations of the polar thermosphere. A first experimental view of the strong coupling between the thermosphere and ionosphere has also emerged from these combined new data-sets. In parallel with the development of observing techniques, numerical models of the thermosphere and ionosphere have matured. We are at a state where the combined thermosphere and ionosphere can be modelled self-consistently. We can now realistically simulate the response of the combined system to the magnetospheric forcing, and also investigate the many and varied feedback processes between the two components. The models can be used to understand and interpret the diversity of experimental observations, and provide the framework for evaluating phenomena which are as yet not well understood. The dominant thermosphere--ionosphere interactions which appear from the modelling studies and which have counterparts in the experimental database can be summarized. In the winter polar region, ionization enhancements are observed which are due to auroral particle precipitation in both the E-region and in the F-region. The former are relatively easy to understand, since decay rates are generally rapid, and large-scale transport is unimportant. The sole caveat will be related to sporadic-E layers of long-lived metallic ions. In the polar F-region, neutral winds, neutral composition changes, convection changes and solar photoionization all cause important modifications of plasma distributions. In the winter, plasma convection and winds cause important effects in the horizontal and vertical transport of plasma, respectively. As such, plumes of high density (or low-density) plasma are transported large distances from their origin, and local plasma densities are rarely explicable by local sources and sinks. The exact distributions will depend very much on detailed plasma convection patterns. However, the winter subauroral trough and localized polar troughs will be created when the combination of convection and corotation cause plasma stagnation in regions out of sunlight and photoionization. There is a strong U.T. modulation of plasma density within the winter polar cap and dusk auroral oval (generally) as the polar cusp enters sunlight for a few hours around 18h U.T., and there is a direct source of high-density plasma (photoionization plus particle ionization) convected through the cusp. At other U.Ts, the source is generally cut off, and polar plasma densities generally decay. Summer F-region high-latitude and polar plasma densities are generally a factor of about 3-5 lower than in winter. This is due to the seasonal F-region neutral composition variation, generated by summer to winter mean circulation, by which increased plasma recombination rates (due to much higher molecular nitrogen densities) more than compensate for the increased solar photoionization source in the summer polar cap. In turn, this mean circulation is generated by the combination of asymmetric solar insolation and greater geomagnetic heating in the summer compared with winter polar regions (Rees et al. 1985, 1987). Particularly at times of high geomagnetic activity, the summer {\textquoteleft}F-region{\textquoteright} neutral composition is close to that of the standard atmosphere E-region. The major features of the summer polar F-region are thus quite different to those of the corresponding winter region. Plasma troughs develop in regions of very strong Joule heating, i.e. where ion convection is strongest. As such, the location and intensity of the troughs is quite dependent on the plasma convection patterns. Summer-time troughs tend to occur in the same regions where rapid transport causes high-density plasma plumes in the winter polar region. The classical subauroral trough is distinctly a feature of the winter polar F-region. Even at equinox, the full subauroral trough does not develop, while in winter it fully encircles the geomagnetic polar cap for much of the U.T. day (except around 18h U.T.). In the summer F-region, stagnation troughs do not develop within the polar cap, irrespective of convection pattern. Any polar cap troughs are a result of changes in neutral composition. Subauroral troughs can only develop around the summer polar region when the auroral oval is expanded so that the midnight part of the auroral oval extends into the nightside. Conditions for this situation are likely to occur preferentially in the southern polar region, due to the greater offset of the geomagnetic from geographic pole. The E-region response to geomagnetic forcing is also strong, although generally rather less marked than in the F-region, in terms of the neutral thermal and compositional response. The major feed-back between the thermosphere and ionosphere occurs due to the effects of high induced winds, since the neutral chemical changes do not significantly affect the ionospheric chemistry. Apart from localized effects such as sporadic-E layers, high-speed auroral oval winds do not cause significant vertical transport of E-region molecular species, due to rapid recombination. The most significant vertical transport effects will be in non-sunlit regions, where ion production is lowest. The dynamo effect of induced E-region winds of 200-400 m s$^{-1}$ is also quite significant. Such winds reduce horizontal currents, with an implication that the FAC or Pedersen currents may also be decreased, with a possible feedback to the convection electric field. There is still relatively little data available for detailed case-study comparisons. Such studies have been quite successful in improving our understanding of the F-region behaviour, and the CEDAR initiative and programmes such as LTCS promise to extend the range of multiparameter data-sets to the E-region as well. Simulating atmospheric density and compositional structure with numerical models is one of the most testing demands. Density at a given altitude is very sensitive to the total thermospheric energy budget, and is thus liable to be the first casualty of cumulative small errors in the many external terms of the energy input. There are also some indeterminate factors in the radiative energy budget of the lower thermosphere and upper mesosphere. In practice, we have found that the present version of the coupled model computes density and composition relatively accurately, compared with mean mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter (MSIS) predictions for comparable solar and geomagnetic activity levels and for different seasonal conditions. Typical differences (MSIS to model) of around 20\% occur at F-region altitudes in the data-sets shown in the model simulations described within this paper. This is roughly comparable with the standard deviation of MSIS in comparison with satellite data-sets for specific locations and times. The numerical models have greater spatial and temporal resolution than MSIS models and relate to real physical processes. Undoubtedly, however, the real thermosphere contains a whole spectrum of high-frequency variations which are beyond present parametrization techniques, our current description of geomagnetic inputs and present computer limitations. From the initial coupled-model simulations it is possible to examine key features of the coupling between the magnetosphere and the thermosphere--ionosphere. Field-aligned currents reflect the divergence or convergence of the ionospheric Pedersen current. The Pedersen current depends on changes of the ionospheric conductivity and also the dynamo effects of induced winds. Both FAC and E-region winds display considerable seasonal, U.T. and geomagnetic activity variations. Except in the unlikely event that the magnetosphere acts as a {\textquoteleft}zero-resistance{\textquoteright} source of charge, and momentum, etc., we would anticipate, on the basis of these thermosphere--ionosphere model simulations, to see corresponding modulation of magnetosphere--ionosphere forcing as a function of U.T., season and geomagnetic activity. However, a detailed theoretical evaluation of such processes will have to await the development of a new range of coupled models embracing the near-Earth environment. As new experimental data from coordinated ground-based campaigns becomes available over the next several years, and it is to be hoped from new space missions within the next decade, we may hope that the validity of many of the simplified assumptions we currently have to make within present models can be tested. Undoubtedly, many present concepts will be found wanting. The impact of global images of particle precipitation and energy deposition, coupled with perhaps the development of techniques of imaging polar plasma convection patterns will mean that future models are capable of looking at the effects of short period and smaller-scale variations in forcing. The present patterns of magnetospheric forcing are too simplified and averaged in time and space. While the thermosphere averages out rapid and short-scale momentum inputs, the energy input integrates all variations, including the effect of rapid forcing variations. The thermospheric composition responds to this {\textquoteleft}additional{\textquoteright} energy source in a way which presently cannot be simulated accurately, and we already know how sensitive the polar plasma environment appears to be to thermospheric composition changes forced by the combined solar and magnetospheric forcing. We are indebted to Dr Fred Rich for provision of the Heppner \&amp; Maynard polar electric fields in the form of harmonic coefficients.

During geomagnetically active times, above about 170 km, the cells consist of density enhancements near noon and midnight and depletions near dawn and dusk. In this paper, a previously unexplained observation is presented and interpreted in terms of the cells. In general the high latitude neutral density is expected to increase during magnetically active conditions. On the contrary, the SETA-1 satellite measured a 40% density decrease near 200 km during the geomagnetic storm of April 3, 1979. In the past, such ‘anomalous’ observations have often been attributed to the inseparability of density and winds in accelerometer measurements. We first show that the depletion cannot be caused by winds, and then show that the depletion is a natural consequence of the cellular structure inherent in the mass density at 200 km.},

  abstract = {NCAR-TIGCM simulations predict mesoscale cellular structures in the high latitude neutral density at altitudes from 120–350 km. During magnetically active conditions, the density structure at 200 km consists of low-density cells near dawn and dusk and high-density cells near noon and midnight. Mechanisms causing the structured density cells are a result of thermosphere-ionosphere coupling and can be explained in terms of dynamic meteorology. For example, at high latitudes ion drag causes the neutral circulation to flow cyclonically in the dawn sector and anticyclonically in the dusk sector. Low densities are contained within the cyclonic circulation at all altitudes. Below about 170 km, the densities inside the anticyclonic flow are high, while above that altitude densities within the anticyclonic flow are low. While typical dynamic meteorology explains low densities in the centre of cyclonic circulation and high densities inside anticyclonic circulation, the dusk low-density cell in the centre of anticyclonic flow is unexpected. The anticyclonic dusk low-density cell is explained by anomalous antibaric flow due to high-speed winds. 120 km and 200 km altitudes are used to demonstrate the relationship between the high latitude densities and winds as well as the effect of joule heating and auroral particle precipitation on the density structures. },

The structure consists of density cells above 50° latitude with radii of approximately 1000 km. There are between two to four cells present depending on the altitude and magnetic activity. For example, at 200 km under magnetically active conditions, the density structure consists of four cells: low density cells are located near dawn and dusk and high density cells are located near noon and midnight. Density variations among the cells range from 5 to 50% for magnetically quiet and active conditions respectively. The cells are present at all seasons, for a wide range of magnetic activity levels, and at solar minimum and solar maximum. The density cell morphology is established for equinox solar maximum as a function of altitude and magnetic activity. Departures of the cell structure from this morphology due to seasonal and solar cycles are discussed. The cell morphology provides a new framework in which to interpret lower thermospheric density data. Data to test and confirm the model predictions were provided by the SETA-1 satellite.},

For the first time, a FUV-based and Kp-dependent model of global auroral products (Eo, Q) was developed using 4 years (2002–2005) of \{GUVI\} data and Epstein function fitting. This FUV-based model covers all Kp ranges (0–9). Due to the large spatial coverage of \{FUV\} auroral images, the \{FUV\} measurements lead to a more consistent estimation of the auroral hemispheric power.

A total number of 3,805,000/1,215,000 points for poleward/equatorward boundary were identified from the dataset. It is found that the poleward/equatorward boundaries show an equatorward movement with the increase of Kan-Lee electric field. The poleward/equatorward boundaries in the nightside sector (1800-0600 MLT) show an equatorward motion with the increase of the value of IMF By and the north-south electric field. The equatorward boundary (1800-0300 MLT) shows a quasi-linear equatorward displacement with the increase of solar wind dynamic pressure and speed. The poleward boundary (excluding midday sector) and equatorward boundary expand equatorward with the increase of AE index. The auroral oval boundary model with input parameters of the three components of IMF, solar wind speed and density, and AE is developed by using multivariate regression method. Evaluation of the model shows that the mean absolute deviation of the model in every MLT sector is 1.3-2.1° MLAT for the poleward boundary and 1.3-2.5° MLAT for the equatorward boundary, respectively, when input parameters are within valid value coverage (three components of IMF are each from -8 to +8 nT, and the values of solar wind speed and density, and AE are not more than 550 km/s, 20/cm-3, and 520 nT, respectively).},

The characteristics were determined for each whole number value of Kp from 0 to 5 and for Kp ≥ 6-. At each level of Kp, the high-latitude region was gridded, and the average electron spectrum in the energy range from 50 eV to 20 keV was determined in each grid element. The results show that the high-latitude precipitation region separates into two parts based on the electron average energy. There is a region of relatively hot electrons (EAVE ≥ 600 eV). In this region, the electron average energies are highest on the morningside of the oval. There are two average energy maxima at each Kp level: one postmidnight and the other prenoon. The hot electron region is generally not continuous in MLT but shows a gap between 1200 and 1800 MLT. The hotter electrons carry most of the energy flux into the oval. The energy flux on the nightside increases with Kp, while the level at noon increases with Kp when Kp is small but decreases at higher Kp. The average energy of the hot electrons increases from Kp = 0 to Kp = 3 but is approximately constant for higher Kp. In the second region, average energies are low (EAVE < 600 eV). This region extends from the poleward edge of the hot electron region to the pole. The precipitating electrons in this region carry the majority of the number flux at high latitudes. The largest number fluxes are found on the dayside. The highest fluxes are confined to a crescent-shaped region centered slightly prenoon and extending in MLT over most of dayside and, in some cases, into the nightside. There is a prenoon maximum in the number flux that shows little variability in MLT or in intensity with Kp. The average energy shows a minimum typically between 1100 and 1200 MLT and located toward the poleward edge of the crescent-shaped region of highest integral number flux. We identify the cusp as the region near the average energy minimum and the cleft as the crescent-shaped region.},
