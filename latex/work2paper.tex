\begin{abstract} 
    This study conducts a superposed epoch analysis with the thermospheric mass densities near the geographic poles 
    during the years 2002-2010 derived from the accelerometer onboard the GRACE satellite.
    The geographic poles are preferred for multiple reasons. 
    Firstly, the GRACE satellite passes near the poles in its every orbit.
    Secondly, the longitude and local time effects can be neglected at the poles, so we can focus on 
    universal time (UT) variations. 
    More importantly, the south pole passes near the cusp location at about 1530 UT every day.
    Our results show that the thermospheric densities near the south pole are enhanced by up to 16\% of
    the daily mean at about 1600 UT, which may result from the periodic pass of the cusp zone.
    It is also found that the UT variation depends on solar wind sector structure and solar activity.
    Near the south pole, it is likely to observe a more apparent and enhanced UT variation when the earth is
    embedded in an away (-Bx, +By) solar wind sector polarity.
    The opposite applies to the north pole.
    In addition, stronger solar activities may enhance the UT change in thermospheric densities near 
    both the south and north poles.

\section{Introduction}
    The universal time (UT)/longitudinal variations in the thermospheric density or temperature have been long 
    discussed \citep[e.g.,][]{Hedin1972, Hedin1979, Hedin1985, Xu2013a, Xu2013}. 
    At high latitudes, the UT/longitudinal variations of the thermosphere are interpreted to the localized polar 
    heating associated with soft electron precipitation \citep{Hedin1972}. 
    \citet{Xu2013} analyzed the longitudinal structure of the thermospheric density by using the daily mean 
    thermospheric mass densities derived from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. 
    Their results show that there are density peaks near the magnetic poles. 
    It is generally difficult to distinguish the UT and longitudinal variations since UT and longitude change 
    synchronously at a fixed local time (LT). 
    However, near the geographic poles, the longitude and LT effects are not an issue. 
    The UT effect could be therefore isolated at this region. 
    In the present work, we will focus on the pole zones.

    The geographic poles are preferred also because they provide the opportunity to investigate thermospheric 
    density variations in the cusp region. 
    \citet{Luhr2004} found that the thermospheric density is enhanced by almost a factor of two near the polar cusp. 
    Since then, a large quantity of work has devoted to investigating the energy source of the density enhancement 
    \citep[e.g.,][]{Deng2011, Knipp2011, Zhang2012, Deng2013, Zhang2015}.  
    However, no studies noticed the relationship between geographic poles and polar cusps. 
    The magnetic latitudes (MLAT) of the north and south geographic poles in the apex coordinates are about $83^{\circ}$ 
    and $-74^{\circ}$, respectively. 
    The south pole is quite close to the polar cusp in the magnetic latitude direction. 
    The magnetic local time (MLT) of geographic poles changes as the earth rotates. 
    The south pole gets close to 1200 MLT at about 1530 UT. In other words, the south pole periodically passes near 
    the dayside cusp at about 1530 UT. 
    Therefore it is expected that the high altitude thermospheric density near the south pole increases at
    about 1530 UT due to enhanced energy precipitation from the magnetosphere \citep{Luhr2004}.

    In this paper, we mainly used thermospheric densities near the geographic poles, which were derived from
    the accelerometer onboard the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. 
    A superposed epoch analysis was conducted to the data to present the UT variation of the thermospheric density,
    which might be related to the pole's periodical passage through the dayside cusp. 
    We chose the zero epoch time as 0000 UT of the day when the solar wind sector polarity changes from away from to 
    toward the sun or the opposite.
    The reason for the choice is that the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) y component exerts an effect on the
    density response to the cusp energy precipitation \citep{Crowley2010, Knipp2011, Li2011}.

\section{Data and Method}
    In this study, we used the version 2.3 data for GRACE accelerometer-derived thermospheric total mass 
    densities during the years 2002-2010 \citep{Sutton2011}. 
    The twin GRACE satellites were launched into an near-circular orbit in March 2002.
    There are approximately 15 orbits in one day for GRACE satellites.
    The inclination of the satellites is about $89.5^\circ$.
    Therefore the GRACE satellite passes by the south and north geographic poles nearly 15 times in any specified day, 
    which could well include the UT variations.
    In the present work, thermospheric mass densities for poleward of $88.5^\circ$ and $-88.5^\circ$ were used to
    represent the north and south geographical poles.
    The initial altitude of the GRACE satellite is approximately 500 km, and it gradually decreases to about 475 km
    in 2010. 
    During the same period, the altitude change for CHAMP satellite is from about 420 km to approximately 320 km.
    The thermospheric density response to external forcings at a fixed altitude is associated with the 
    distance from the energy deposition altitude \citep{Lei2010a}.
    \citet{Clemmons2008} even found a small density depletion in the cusp relative to the adjacent areas at about 250 km.
    The GRACE satellite is prefered to the CHAMP satellite partly due to the smaller height drop, which can weaken the
    altitude effect.
    Note that the thermospheric densities are normalized to 400 km to remove the altitude change in a day.

    The events investigated in the present paper were the earth passage of the solar wind sector boundary, which is defined
    by \citet{Svalgaard1976}.
    120 away to toward and 122 toward to away cases were found during the investigated period. 
    Note that some cases are excluded for the data gap of the thermospheric density.
    And the cased were distributed fairly evenly in seasons.
    The zero epoch time assigned to these events is 0000 UT of the sector polarity transition day.
