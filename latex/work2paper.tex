\begin{abstract}
This study conducts a superposed epoch analysis with the thermospheric mass densities near the geographic poles during the years 2002-2010 derived from the accelerometer onboard the GRACE satellite. The geographic poles are preferred for multiple reasons. Firstly, the GRACE satellite passes near the poles in its every orbit. Secondly, the longitude and local time effects can be neglected at the poles, so we can focus on universal time (UT) variations. More importantly, the south pole passes near the cusp location at about 1600 UT every day. Our results show that the thermospheric densities near the south pole are enhanced by up to 16\% of the daily mean at about 1600 UT, which may result from the periodic pass of the cusp zone. It is also found that the UT variation depends on solar wind sector structure and solar activity. Near the south pole, it is likely to observe a more apparent and enhanced UT variation when the earth is embedded in an away (-Bx, +By) solar wind sector polarity. The opposite applies to the north pole. In addition, stronger solar activities may enhance the UT change in thermospheric densities near both the south and north poles.

\section{Introduction}
    The universal time (UT) and longitudinal variations in thermospheric density or temperature have been long discussed \citep [e.g.,][]{Hedin1972, Hedin1979, Hedin1985, Xu2013a, Xu2013}. At high latitudes, the UT and longitudinal variations of thermosphere are interpreted to the localized polar heating associated with soft electron precipitation \citep{Hedin1972}. \citet[Xu2013] analyzed the longitudinal structure of the thermospheric density by using the daily mean thermospheric mass density. Their results showed that the density peaks locate near the magnetic poles.

\section{Conclusions}
In the present study, Near both north and south geographic poles, there was a clear UT variation in the thermospheric densities. At the south pole, the density could be enhanced by up to 16\% of the daily mean at about 16:00UT (~12:24 MLT). The UT variation of the pole densities might result from the periodic pass of the cusp zone.
